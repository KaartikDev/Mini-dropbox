# Mini-Dropbox (WIP)

A work-in-progress file storage web app inspired by Dropbox/Google Photos. Built with React (frontend) and AWS S3 (storage).  

## Goal
The project’s goal is to create a **personal alternative to iCloud, Google Drive, and other paid storage services**. By integrating directly with AWS S3, users can store files more flexibly and at a lower cost compared to monthly subscription fees for consumer cloud platforms.  

## Features
- **User Authentication** – Sign in and sign out with secure login.
- **File Uploads** – Upload individual files or zipped folders.
- **Gallery View** – Uploaded photos are displayed in a clean, responsive gallery.
- **AWS S3 Integration** – Files are stored and retrieved directly from an S3 bucket.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React, JavaScript, React Router
- **Authentication:** OIDC / OAuth2 (configurable provider)
- **Storage:** AWS S3
- **Hosting (optional):** Vercel / Netlify / AWS Amplify
